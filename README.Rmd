# Grundy Number of a Queen Graph

Could the Grundy number of a n x n Queen graph be 2n?
Some tenuous evidence in this plot.

For Grundy numbers we want something that works like
Kempe reductions but does the opposite. To increase
the number of colours used.

```{r other_results_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8}
library(targets)

tar_read(plot)
```
